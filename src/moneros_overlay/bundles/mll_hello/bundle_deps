# Each overlay bundle may have dependencies on third party artifacts. This
# particular overlay bundle depends on 'libc.so.6' which is provided by the
# 'glibg_libc' overlay bundle, so we put it as dependency. All dependency
# bundles are processed before the main bundle.

# Note that in this particular case we can skip this dependency, because 'libc'
# is provided as core dependency of 'Busybox'.
